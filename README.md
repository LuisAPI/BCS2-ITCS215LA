### Midterm period structure
 
# | Type | File | Description
----|----|----|----
1 | PDF | ITCS215LA_M_LA1_ConsiderImprovements_Imperial.pdf | We were asked to think of an app we used often and describe how it could be improved.
2 | FIG | ITCS215LA_M_LA1 Imperial.fig | Learn Figma step-by-step 1/
3 | PNG | Imperial_MActivity1.png | Screengrab of Figma with sign-in button
4 | PNG | Imperial_MActivity2.png | Screengrab of Figma with two slides, sign-in button and log-in screen
5 | FIG | ITCS215LA_M_LA2 Imperial.fig | Learn Figma step-by-step 2/
6 | FIG | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity3.fig | Learn Figma step-by-step 3/
7 | PNG | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity3.png | A third screen added, showing buttons and icons created using primitive drawing tools
8 | PNG | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity4 Screenshot.png | Two new screens added, displaying a hypothetical photo sharing app‚Äôs content view and timeline interfaces
9 | FIG | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity4.fig | Learn Figma step-by-step 4/
10 | PDF | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity4.pdf | Now the collation of screengrabs is an entire document
11 | TXT | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity5.txt | Our prof since asked us to link directly to the original slide deck from the cloud
12 | PDF | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity5 Frame-Gallery.pdf | Show screen displaying creation of menu screen
13 | TXT | Imperial_MActivity6.txt | The sixth activity, or so I assumed.
14 | PNG | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity6 Screenshot.png | Landscape versions of past created screens.
15 | FIG | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity6 Source.fig | Source of aforementioned screengrab.
16 | PDF | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity6 Frame-Gallery.pdf | The same screens, but displayed page-by-page in a PDF document.
17 | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity5-Plus.pdf | We were asked to create a dozen versions of the same content display screen, to mimic a functioning app.
18 | ITCS215LA Imperial_MActivity5-Plus-1.pdf | And then create landscape versions of these.
19 | Imperial_MActivity6.pdf | So many screens. So much busywork. üòµ‚Äçüí´
20 | Imperial_MActivity_DragGesture.fig | Trial for drag gesture.
21 | Imperial_MActivity_DragGesture.pdf | The screens behind the sample app for drag gesture movement.
22 | Imperial_MActivity4_ProgramLogo.fig | The creation of a logo for our program, BSc in Computer Science.
23 | Imperial_MActivity4_ProgramLogo.pdf | Looks neat alongside our university‚Äôs college department logos, no?
